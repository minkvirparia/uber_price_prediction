## Project Journey 🌟

Throughout this project, I aimed to:

- **Explore Real-World Data:** I delved into real-world ride data to uncover patterns and insights. This hands-on experience helped me understand the factors influencing Uber fares. 📈🔍

- **Transform Raw Data:** Feature engineering played a key role. I learned how to create meaningful features from raw data, including time-based calculations and distance metrics. 🛠️🔢

- **Experiment with Models:** I experimented with machine learning models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest. This allowed me to gain practical experience and see how different algorithms perform. 🤓🤖

- **Evaluate Model Performance:** I evaluated my models using industry-standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This step helped me assess the quality of my predictions. 📊📉

- **Interpret Model Results:** Understanding the importance of features and interpreting model results was a fascinating part of the journey. It helped me make data-driven decisions. 🧐🔍
